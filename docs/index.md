Welcome to the <a href="http://lab.vanderbilt.edu/mint-lab" target="_blank">Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) Lab</a> at Vanderbilt University! We are an undergradate team under <a href="https://skolouri.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Kolouri</a>, focusing on the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in the area of continual learning.

But wait. What is catastrophic forgetting? Check our [first project](projects/1_project) that thoroughly explains this term using relatively simple examples.

Under Dr. Kolouri's guidance, we have surveyed existing methods to solve the catastrophic forgetting, including Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synapsis intelligence (SI), etc. Check our [project page](projects/), which contains a series of explanations, examples, and experiments on those methods.

In the future, we will continue to expand our survey list and explore selective forgetting, a technique to make previously trained synapsis plastic again. For now, we are researching the masking technique, such that we fix the weights of a certain number of neurons in the model to maintain the model performance. Check [this post](projects/5_project) if you are interested in masking.

Before we continue, we want to truly appreciate Dr. Kolouri for leading us into the area of continual learning and offering a tremendous amount of help during this project. It would be impossible for us to finish the project and the website without Dr. Kolouri.
